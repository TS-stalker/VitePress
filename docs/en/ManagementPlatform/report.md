## 1. Overview

The Report Design module provides powerful and flexible data visualization and export tools. It includes both **system-built historical reports** and supports users to completely **customize report formats**, aiming to provide intuitive and user-friendly display methods for key production data. All report data is based on **datasets**, giving users full freedom to view and analyze core production data. Its main functions are **data visualization display** and **structured data download**. As shown in Figure 1-1.

## 2. Report Creation and Management (Function Operation Area)

1. Add Report

When clicking the **"Add"** button to create a report, you can choose two creation types:

| Report Type | Data Source and Features                                                                                                                      | Configuration Description                                                                |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Historical Report | Data comes from the data sets you pre-configured in "Dataset". Suitable for standardized chart and table displays based on structured data. | When creating, you need to select one from the dataset list as the data source for this report. As shown in Figure 1-2. |
| Template Report | Based on custom template files uploaded by users (such as Excel, Word in specific formats), dynamically fill data into specified positions in the template. Suitable for generating formal documents or reports with fixed format requirements. | When creating, you need to upload a pre-designed template file. As shown in Figure 1-3. |

If the type is Historical Report, a dataset from the dataset list will be selected as the data source, as shown in Figure 1-2.

## 3. Report Display and Interaction (Data Display Area)

After the report is created, click to enter the display and operation interface.

### 1. Dynamic Data Query and Visualization

In the report display interface, you can perform the following interactive operations to obtain the desired data view:

- **Filter Data**: Select **time range**, **statistical method** (such as sum, average), **sampling method** (such as original value, maximum per hour) to dynamically filter and calculate data.
- **Chart Display**: This module supports **graphical display** functions (such as line charts, bar charts), presenting data in a more intuitive and visual form, helping to quickly understand data trends and patterns. As shown in Figure 1-4.

### 2. Data Export

The report interface provides convenient **export functions**, supporting exporting current query results or visual charts to multiple formats (such as Excel), facilitating archiving, sharing, or further analysis.

Through the Report Design module, you can transform raw data into reports with clear information and professional forms, effectively supporting decision analysis and information communication.
