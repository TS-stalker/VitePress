## 3. Quick Start

1. Select the ellipse control from the toolbar
2. Place the mouse at the target position on the canvas, hold down the left mouse button
3. Drag the mouse to adjust the ellipse size and shape
4. Release the left mouse button to complete ellipse creation
5. Adjust ellipse size through the 8 control points (positions 1-8) of the selection box
6. Use the rotation control point (position 9) to adjust the ellipse angle
7. Precisely set size, position, and style in the property panel
