## 1. Overview

DipuOne has a built-in set of fully functional shape drawing tools. Using these tools, you can directly draw and edit basic geometric shapes and custom shapes on the canvas, thereby enriching the visual elements of the interface without relying on external images.



## 2. Shape Controls Overview

The shape controls provided by the system include:

| Control Name | Main Function           |
| ---- | -------------- |
| Ellipse   | Draw elliptical or circular shapes.     |
| Rectangle   | Draw right-angled rectangles or squares.    |
| Round Rectangle | Draw rectangles with adjustable rounded corners.  |
| Straight Line   | Draw line segments of any angle and length. |
| Horizontal Line  | Draw lines that strictly maintain horizontal direction. |
| Vertical Line  | Draw lines that strictly maintain vertical direction. |

The graphics created by these shape controls, like regular controls, **support property binding, animation, and action configuration**, and can be perfectly integrated into your interactive application design.
