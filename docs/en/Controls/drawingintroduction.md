## 1. Overview

DipuOne has a built-in set of fully functional drawing tools. Using these tools, you can directly draw and edit basic geometric shapes and custom shapes on the canvas, thereby enriching the visual elements of the interface without relying on external images.



## 2. Drawing Controls Overview

The drawing controls provided by the system include:

| Control Name | Main Function                       |
| ---- | -------------------------- |
| Zigzag Line   | Draw zigzag paths formed by connecting multiple line segments.          |
| Polygon  | Draw closed polygons composed of multiple sides (such as triangles, pentagons, etc.). |
| Pipeline   | Draw pipeline shapes used to represent processes or connections.          |

The graphics created by these drawing controls, like regular controls, **support property binding, animation, and action configuration**, and can be perfectly integrated into your interactive application design.
